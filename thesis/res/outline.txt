for each test.c:
    CHECK_SYNTAX_CHECK:
    check_src_validation_by_clang(add read()/write() delcation.) 
        and compile_by_cc (they should be same)
    
    GET_CODE_COV:
    insert _my_func in test.c(use clang to find where to insert)
    cc compile test_inserted.c > a.ir
    for all inputs:
        a.ir executed by irsim-cli.py
        parse stdout and get coverage.
    get code coverage  <input, output>
    
    ITERATE:
    random delete(or change) unexecuted code, get test_new.c 
    for all optimization level:
        cc compile test_new.c > a_new.ir
        for all inputs:
            a_new.ir executed by irsim-cli.py
            assert(a_new.ir(input)==output[input])
